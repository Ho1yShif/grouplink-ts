# grouplink

Render's links page. The page is plain HTML on a Render static site. A Render
Workflow reads the link list from Notion, enriches it, commits `site/index.html`,
and deploys.

It replaces a Linktree page that couldn't be styled to brand and was two-thirds
Linktree's own affiliate marketplace.

Links are rendered exactly as the Notion row gives them. Put any tracking
parameters in the Notion URL itself.

## Pipeline

`src/rebuild.ts` — one task, `grouplink.rebuild`:

```
grouplink.rebuild
├── notion.queryDatabase   ×2   read the link rows and the people
├── kv.get              ×N      look for cached metadata
├── scrape.extractMetadata ×N   scrape the misses
├── kv.set              ×N      cache them for 24h
├── http.request        ×N      health-check every link
├── github.listTree             which pages already exist on the branch
├── github.getFileContents ×N   skip the pages that haven't changed
├── github.commitFiles          write the changed pages, in one commit
├── render.triggerDeploy
├── render.awaitDeploy
└── slack.postMessage           the live URL, or the dead links
```

Every `ctx.run` is a separate durable run with the owning package's retry policy.
The `×N` steps fan out into independent chained runs, ten at a time, so a large
database does not open one run per link or hit every site at once. The URLs are
deduplicated first, so a link on three pages is scraped and health-checked once.

The health check counts a link as dead when it answers 404, 5xx, or nothing at all.
A 401, 403, 405, 429, or 999 means the site is up and refusing a request with no
browser fingerprint, which is what X and LinkedIn do.

A run starts when someone edits Notion. `grouplink-webhook` is a small web
service that verifies Notion's signature, drops the event types that can't
change a page, and waits 60 seconds of quiet before dispatching
`grouplink.rebuild`. Editing eight rows in one sitting gives you one run.

There is no schedule. The run is also what health-checks every link, so a link
that rots is only reported the next time someone edits Notion.

If the run itself fails, it posts the error to Slack and rethrows. The receiver
has already answered Notion by then, so its response says nothing about how the
run went.

A run commits and deploys unless you set `DRY_RUN=true`. A dry run reads, scrapes,
caches, and health-checks, then returns the model without writing anything.

## Run it locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
cp .env.example .env      # fill in NOTION_TOKEN, NOTION_LINKS_DATABASE_ID, REDIS_URL
render workflows dev -- pnpm dev
```

In another terminal:

```bash
render workflows tasks list --local
render workflows start grouplink.rebuild --local --input='[{"dryRun":true}]'
```

### Previewing the page

`pnpm preview` reads both Notion databases, scrapes each card's description, and
writes one `site/<slug>/index.html` per person plus the root copy. It needs
`NOTION_TOKEN`, both database IDs, and `SITE_DEFAULT_SLUG` in `.env`. It never
commits, deploys, or touches Key Value, so no `REDIS_URL` is needed.

```bash
pnpm preview
pnpm serve                # http://localhost:3000
```

`pnpm serve` reloads the browser when a file under `site/` changes. Saving a
file under `src/` re-runs `pnpm placeholder` first, so an edit to the page shows
up right away — that rewrites every page under `site/` from the seed links and
drops the preview's real content. Run `pnpm preview` again to get it back.

The pages under `site/` are tracked, so `git checkout -- site && git clean -fd site`
undoes a preview.

`pnpm placeholder` regenerates the pages under `site/` from the seed links
without touching Notion, for looking at the design before the databases exist.
It writes `/shifra`, `/graham`, and a copy of the root person's page at `/`, the
same shape a real run produces.

## The Notion databases

There are two. Links:

| Property   | Type     | Purpose                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Title`    | title    | Card text. Not scraped — this is the copy you control.                         |
| `URL`      | url      | Where the card points.                                                         |
| `Icon`     | select   | Which icon the card shows. Empty means `arrow`.                                |
| `Visible`  | checkbox | Unchecked rows are dropped.                                                    |
| `Everyone` | checkbox | Checked puts the link on every person's page.                                  |
| `People`   | relation | Which pages the link appears on. Relate it to two rows and it appears on both. |

People:

| Property  | Type  | Purpose                                     |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`    | title | The heading on that person's page.          |
| `Slug`    | text  | The URL path. `shifra` serves at `/shifra`. |
| `Tagline` | text  | The page description in the metadata. Not shown on the page. |

### Icons

Each card draws an icon from `site/assets/link-icons/`. The `Icon` select option
is the filename without `.png`, so the options are `arrow`, `credits`,
`download`, `form`, `info`, `render`, `upload`, and `workflows`. An empty cell
renders `arrow`. An option no file matches also renders `arrow`, and the run logs
the value it could not place.

The files are dark artwork on transparency, drawn as CSS masks and painted with
the text color, so they read on both the light and the dark background. To add
one, drop a 32×32 RGBA PNG in that directory, add its name to `ICON_NAMES` in
`src/icons.ts`, and add the option to the Notion dropdown.

A link's audience is `Everyone` plus whatever `People` names. A row with both set
is redundant, not contradictory, and a row with neither renders nowhere.

A person's page is written to `site/<slug>/index.html`. The person named by
`SITE_DEFAULT_SLUG` is written to `site/index.html` as well, so `/` and their own
path serve the same page.

Share both databases with the Notion integration that owns `NOTION_TOKEN`.

Reading a relation needs `@render-lab/tasks-notion` 0.6.0 or later.

## Configuration

| Var                                      | Default | Purpose                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `NOTION_TOKEN`                           | —       | Notion integration token.                       |
| `NOTION_LINKS_DATABASE_ID`               | —       | The links database.                             |
| `NOTION_PEOPLE_DATABASE_ID`              | —       | The people database.                            |
| `REDIS_URL`                              | —       | Key Value instance holding the metadata cache.  |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`                           | —       | Write access to the site repo. See below.       |
| `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER` / `GITHUB_REPO_NAME` | —       | Where the page is committed.                    |
| `GITHUB_BRANCH`                          | `main`  | Branch to commit to.                            |
| `RENDER_API_KEY`                         | —       | Used to trigger the static site deploy.         |
| `RENDER_STATIC_SITE_ID`                  | —       | The static site to deploy.                      |
| `SITE_URL`                               | —       | Public URL, quoted in the Slack message.        |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`                      | —       | Optional. Unset logs the digest to the console. |
| `DRY_RUN`                                | `false` | Set `true` to skip the commit and the deploy.   |
| `SITE_DEFAULT_SLUG`                      | —       | Slug of the person the root page shows.         |
| `SITE_DIR`                               | `site`  | Directory the pages are committed under.        |
| `METADATA_TTL_SECONDS`                   | `86400` | How long a scraped description is cached.       |
| `LINKS_LIMIT`                            | `100`   | Notion rows to read per run.                    |

The webhook receiver reads its own set, plus `RENDER_API_KEY`:

| Var                     | Default             | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `WORKFLOW_SLUG`         | —                   | Slug of the Workflow service to dispatch to.   |
| `NOTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | —                   | Verification token of the Notion subscription. |
| `DISPATCH_TOKEN`        | —                   | Bearer token required on `POST /tasks/:task`.  |
| `REBUILD_TASK`          | `grouplink.rebuild` | Task the webhook dispatches.                   |
| `DEBOUNCE_MS`           | `60000`             | Quiet period before an edit starts a run.      |

Each page's name comes from its People row, not from configuration.

Per-run overrides go in the input: `--input='[{"dryRun":false}]'`.

### The GitHub token

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is the only credential that writes to a repo. `github.commitFiles`
uses it once per run, to write the changed pages to `GITHUB_BRANCH` of
`GITHUB_REPO_OWNER/GITHUB_REPO_NAME`. The run also reads the branch's tree and
the pages already on it to work out which ones changed, and read access to the
contents covers that too.

The value goes straight to Octokit as a bearer credential, and nothing inspects
its shape, so all three GitHub token types work. Test with a personal access
token and run an installation token in production. Only the value changes.

| Token type                    | What it needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fine-grained PAT              | Repository access limited to the site repo, and `Contents` → **Read and write**. GitHub adds the required `Metadata` → **Read** on its own. Leave everything else at no access. GitHub caps expiration at one year unless your org allows longer. |
| Classic PAT                   | `repo` for a private repo, `public_repo` for a public one. Both grant more than the run needs.                                                                                                                                                    |
| GitHub App installation token | Install the app on the site repo with `Contents: Read and write`, then mint an installation token.                                                                                                                                                |

An installation token expires after an hour, so a value pasted into the
environment stops working before the next edit arrives. Something has to mint a
fresh one and update `GITHUB_TOKEN` on the Workflow service through the Render
API. A fine-grained PAT needs no refresh.

If the repo belongs to an org, an org owner has to approve a fine-grained token
before it can write.

Branch protection can reject a token that has the right permission. The commit is
a fast-forward ref update, so a rule on `GITHUB_BRANCH` requiring a pull request
or a passing status check turns it down. Exempt the token, or point
`GITHUB_BRANCH` at an unprotected branch.

An expired or revoked token fails the run at `github.commitFiles`, and that error
goes to Slack. No other step needs GitHub, so the only other symptom is a page
that stops updating.

The token belongs on the Workflow service. `grouplink-webhook` never calls
GitHub, so don't set it there.

## The page

`src/render.ts` is one function returning the whole document — no framework and
no build step. The CSS and the one inline script live in `src/styles.ts`, which
`render.ts` inlines and allows in the page's Content-Security-Policy by hash.
The page follows Render's brand foundations: semantic color tokens with a dark
override, PP Neue Montreal for prose, square corners, 1px hairlines, and purple
reserved for links and focus rings.

The masthead is centered, with the Render wordmark above a row of social icons.
It is the same on every page. The icons are YouTube, LinkedIn, X, GitHub, and
Discord, and they come from `SOCIALS` in `src/render.ts` rather than from Notion,
so editing that list is the only way to change the row. Each label needs a
matching file in `site/assets/icons/`. The wordmark and the icons are white files
drawn as CSS masks and painted with the text color, so they read on both the
light and dark background.

The brand woff2 files under `site/assets/fonts/` are commercial faces. If this
repo needs to stop redistributing them, delete the three `@font-face` blocks and
load Manrope and Roboto Mono instead — the fallback chain already names them.

Assets are referenced from the site root (`/assets/…`) so they resolve the same
from `/` and from `/<slug>/`.

## Deploy

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Ho1yShif/grouplink)

Blueprints don't support Workflows yet, so the Workflow service is created in the
Dashboard and everything else comes from [`render.yaml`](render.yaml).

The Blueprint comes first even though the receiver needs the Workflow's slug,
because the Workflow needs `REDIS_URL` from the Key Value instance and
`RENDER_STATIC_SITE_ID` from the static site, and the Blueprint creates both.
`grouplink-webhook` fails its first deploy as a result: it exits at startup
while `WORKFLOW_SLUG` is empty, and step 5 is what fixes it.

1. Create the Notion connection at
   [notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations).
   Click **+ New connection** and name it `grouplink`. Set the capabilities,
   which are the same for both connection types:
   - Under **Capabilities** in the **Content capabilities** section, keep **Read
     content** and uncheck insert and update content. The run only calls
     `queryDatabase`.
   - Under **User information**, pick **No user information**.

   Then pick a type. **OAuth** works for any Notion account:
   - There is no installation access token and no **⋯ > Connections** step. The
     token comes from a code exchange, and you choose the databases during the
     authorization flow.
   - Follow [Using a public connection](#using-a-public-connection) below, then
     come back here for step 2.

   **Internal** is shorter but needs workspace owner rights:
   - Open the **Configuration** tab and copy the **Installation access token**.
     It starts with `ntn_` and is `NOTION_TOKEN`. Older docs call it the
     Internal Integration Secret.
   - Open the links database in Notion, click **⋯** in the top right, then
     **Connections > Connect to**, and pick `grouplink`. Repeat on the people
     database. The connection reads nothing you haven't connected it to.

   `NOTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` isn't part of either path. Notion generates it when
   you save the subscription in step 6, which needs the receiver's URL.

2. Click the button, or Dashboard → **New > Blueprint** and link this repo. It
   creates the static site (`grouplink-site`), the Key Value instance
   (`grouplink-cache`), and the webhook receiver (`grouplink-webhook`). Leave
   `WORKFLOW_SLUG` blank when it prompts. Note the static site's ID and URL. The
   button reads `render.yaml` from `main`, so push first.
3. Dashboard → **New > Workflow** on the same repo.
   Build: `pnpm install && pnpm build`. Start: `node dist/main.js`. Turn
   auto-deploy off — the workflow commits to this repo, and you don't want it
   redeploying itself every time the page changes.
4. Set the [Configuration](#configuration) vars on the Workflow. The webhook
   receiver's table doesn't apply here. Required:
   - `NOTION_TOKEN`, `NOTION_LINKS_DATABASE_ID`, `NOTION_PEOPLE_DATABASE_ID`.
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO_NAME`. See
     [The GitHub token](#the-github-token).
   - `REDIS_URL`, the internal connection string of `grouplink-cache`.
   - `RENDER_API_KEY` and `RENDER_STATIC_SITE_ID`, the ID you noted at step 2.
   - `SITE_URL` and `SITE_DEFAULT_SLUG`.
   - `DRY_RUN=true` for the first deploy, so a misconfigured run can't publish.
     The default is `false`.

   Optional: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, plus `GITHUB_BRANCH`, `SITE_DIR`,
   `METADATA_TTL_SECONDS`, and `LINKS_LIMIT` if the defaults don't suit.

   Confirm the tasks appear on the service's Tasks page and note the slug.

5. Set `WORKFLOW_SLUG` and `RENDER_API_KEY` on `grouplink-webhook` and redeploy
   it. Leave `NOTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` unset for now.
6. Create the Notion subscription and finish the handshake. See
   [The Notion subscription](#the-notion-subscription).
7. Remove `DRY_RUN` or set it to `false`, then edit a row in Notion.

`autoDeploy` is off on the static site because the workflow triggers its deploy
itself, right after committing.

### The Notion subscription

`NOTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` doesn't exist anywhere until you create the
subscription. Notion mints it and posts it to the receiver, so the Configuration
tab won't show it and there is nothing to look up in advance.

1. Open the connection's **Webhooks** tab — a separate tab from
   **Configuration** — and click **+ Create a subscription**.
2. Set the webhook URL to
   `https://grouplink-webhook.onrender.com/webhooks/notion`. You may need to append your slug to this URL
3. Click the minus sign to unsubscribe from all events so you can select only the ones you need.
   Subscribe to `page.created`, `page.deleted`, `page.undeleted`,
   `page.properties_updated`, `page.content_updated`,
   `data_source.content_updated`, and `data_source.schema_updated`.
4. Click **Create subscription**. Notion immediately posts a one-time
   `verification_token` to the receiver. That request carries no signature, and
   it arrives before there is a secret to check it against, so the receiver
   accepts unsigned bodies while `NOTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset and logs the
   token.
5. Find the line `notion verification_token: ntn_...` in the receiver's logs on
   Render and copy the value.
6. Back on the Webhooks tab, click the **Verify** button next to the
   subscription, paste the token, and confirm.
7. Set the same value as `NOTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` on `grouplink-webhook` and redeploy.
   From then on every request needs a valid `X-Notion-Signature`.

The receiver filters on event type alone. Under Notion API version 2025-09-03 an
event's `data.parent.id` is a data source ID rather than the database ID in
`NOTION_LINKS_DATABASE_ID`, so filtering on the ID would drop every event. Share
the integration with the two databases and nothing else.

### Using a public connection

Creating an internal connection requires workspace owner rights. A public
connection doesn't, so that is the way in if you're a member rather than an
owner. It runs the same code — `@render-lab/tasks-notion` sends whatever is in
`NOTION_TOKEN` as a bearer token, and doesn't care where it came from.

Do the first part with step 1 and the rest after step 2, once the receiver
exists and you know its hostname.

1. Create the connection as above, but set the type to **Public**. Notion asks
   for a company name, a homepage URL, a privacy policy URL, and a terms URL,
   and any reachable page satisfies all four.
2. Set the redirect URI to `https://grouplink-webhook.onrender.com/oauth`,
   substituting the receiver's real hostname if Render had to suffix the name.
   Nothing serves that path, so the redirect 404s and the code stays in the
   address bar. The form prepends `https://` to whatever you type, so a
   `http://localhost` URI can't be entered. Register one redirect URI and no
   more; a second one changes whether `redirect_uri` is required later.
3. Copy the **OAuth client ID** and **OAuth client secret**.
4. Check **Installation scope**. The workspace holding the two databases has to
   be on the list of workspaces allowed to install the connection, and a new
   connection starts out limited to your development workspace.
5. Open the **Authorization URL** from the Configuration tab in a browser. It is
   already built for you, client ID and redirect URI included, and looks like
   this:

   ```
   https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&response_type=code&owner=user&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgrouplink-webhook.onrender.com%2Foauth
   ```

   Pick the links and people databases, and approve. The browser lands on the
   receiver's 404 page. Copy the `?code=` parameter out of the address bar. It
   is a UUID, and it is good for one attempt within ten minutes.

6. Exchange the code. Set all three variables first, and keep the JSON in double
   quotes so the shell expands `$CODE` — single quotes send the literal text and
   Notion answers `Auth code must be a valid UUID`.

   ```bash
   CLIENT_ID=<client id from step 3>
   CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret from step 3>
   CODE=<code from step 5>

   curl -X POST https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/token \
     -u "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{
       \"grant_type\": \"authorization_code\",
       \"code\": \"$CODE\",
       \"redirect_uri\": \"https://grouplink-webhook.onrender.com/oauth\"
     }"
   ```

   Re-run the authorization URL for a fresh code if the exchange fails for any
   reason.

   The `access_token` in the response is `NOTION_TOKEN`. Set it on the Workflow
   at step 4. A public connection has no installation access token, and the
   OAuth client secret is not a substitute — it only authenticates this
   exchange.

Two things differ from the internal path. You choose which pages the connection
can read during the authorization flow rather than through **⋯ > Connections**,
so re-run the flow to add a database later. And the response also carries a
`refresh_token`, because Notion can rotate these tokens. Keep the client ID,
client secret, and refresh token somewhere you can find them, so a run that
starts failing with a 401 at `notion.queryDatabase` is a token exchange away
from working again.

The Webhooks tab works the same either way.

You are done here. Go back to [Deploy](#deploy) and pick up at step 3, the
Workflow service. The `access_token` goes in as `NOTION_TOKEN` at step 4.

### Forcing a run

`POST /tasks/grouplink.rebuild` on the receiver starts a run without waiting for
a Notion edit, and takes the same run input the CLI does:

```bash
curl -X POST https://grouplink-webhook.onrender.com/tasks/grouplink.rebuild \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISPATCH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"dryRun":true}]'
```

## Checks

- `pnpm test` — Tier 1. Hermetic: the composition test drives the real
  `grouplink.rebuild`, routing every chained run to the owning package's `*Impl`
  with a fake at the vendor port. No network, no secrets.
- `pnpm test:live` — Tier 2. Hits real Notion, real sites, and a real
  Key Value instance in dry-run.
- `pnpm typecheck` — types across `src`, `test`, and `scripts`. `pnpm build`
  reads `tsconfig.build.json`, which emits `src` alone.
- `pnpm lint` — Biome's lint rules and formatting. `pnpm format` writes the
  fixes.

## Where the tasks come from

Every step is a published task from
[render-tasks](https://github.com/render-lab/render-tasks), installed from npm:
`@render-lab/tasks-{notion,scrape,render-kv,http,github,render,slack}` and
`@render-lab/triggers`. `.npmrc` pins a single physical copy of `@renderinc/sdk`,
because two copies mean tasks register against different registries and silently
never run.
